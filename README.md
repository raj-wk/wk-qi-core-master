# Quality Improvement Core Profiles (QI-Core)
This repository contains the source for the QI-Core implementation guide, which defines a set of FHIR profiles and extensions for use in clinical quality measurement and decision support. The implementation guide is the result of a harmonization of data requirements between the Quality Data Model (QDM) and the virtual Medical Record (vMR).

The implementation guide is based on [FHIR version 3.0.0 (STU3 candidate)](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/index.html) and depends on the [US Core implementation guide (STU 1)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU1/index.html).

Commits to this repository will automatically trigger a new build of the IG, which will then be published to the following location:
